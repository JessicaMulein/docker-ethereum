# Ethereum Docker

Provide a docker-compose allowing to quickly run a private ethereum network as well as a monitoring dashboard for quick development.

I use the official golang implementation [Geth](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go/) as a base image for the node.

# Getting started

#### Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed

To run the Ethereum networm, run the following:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
